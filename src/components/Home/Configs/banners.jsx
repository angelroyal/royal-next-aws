Built in spacious villa style blocks they are naturally cool and inviting  \n\nThe pool areas are clean, plenty of beds, lots of shade offerings. Adults can get away if they choose and the kid focused pools are literally the other side of the complex. \n\nThe food is fantastic at all outlets. Chefs are continually cooking to keep them well stocked. The a la carte restaurants are great if you have babies as you can sit and actually eat a meal together. \n\nThe highlight has to be the fantastic staff. Everyone with a smile and great at interacting with our very young baby. \n\nI don't normally do going back to the same place but I certainly would consider it with this fab hotel. ",

    text: "My wife and I stayed at this amazing hotel back in March this year. Unfortunately due to family problems I have only just managed to write this review.\nPlease ignore any negative reviews you may read about this hotel...everything is amazing.\nWe stayed in a swim up room for 7 nights. The pool is mainly a plunge pool but to be honest it's no different to a normal communal pool where most people just use it to cool down.\nIt's just nice to have your own space knowing you have your own sun beds, own umbrella, table and chairs and your own pool. We were lucky enough to get section 6 which was overlooking the beach and one if the main pools as well. \nThe room is comfortable with a nice big bed, fridge, which can be restocked using the hotel app every other day. Wide-screen TV and a bathroom with bath and shower. There is plenty if storage space and a seating area before stepping out onto your patio.\nThe hotel is large and is spread over a fair distance. This could be a problem for those with walking difficulties but otherwise it is set out in 6 different blocks and beautiful gardens. There are 2 buffet restaurants, one on the beach and one nearer reception. There are other speciality restaurants but we didn't use these. The buffet restaurants can be busy and a lot has been said about food hygiene at this hotel due to a period of food poisoning a couple of years ago. All I can say is there were plenty of hand gel areas around and neither my wife or I had any problems with the food during our stay. \nThe ONLY negative I have about this place is the night we had a couple of stray dogs walking around the hotel. They weren't acting in a dangerous manor but they do come off the beach and have easy access to he hotel. They do bark and we're following people back to their rooms but it felt more uncomfortable than dangerous. This was our third visit to Cape Verde, once to Boa Vista and twice to Sal and we have always encountered stray dogs so I wouldn't say it's a fault of the actual hotel.\nAnyway take it from me we loved this hotel. We have already booked for another swim up for July 2025 and can't wait to return.",
